# Number Draw Application

This project is a simple web application that allows users to draw a specific number of random numbers within a defined range.

## Features

-   **Random Number Drawing**: Users can specify the number of random numbers they wish to draw, as well as the range (from/to) within which the numbers should be drawn.
-   **Input Validation**: The application checks if the number of numbers to be drawn is greater than the available range, alerting the user if so.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the desired number of numbers to draw in the "Quantity" field.
3. Enter the starting number of the range in the "From" field.
4. Enter the ending number of the range in the "To" field.
5. Click the "Draw" button to generate the random numbers.
6. If the input is invalid, an alert will be displayed. Adjust the inputs accordingly and try again.

## Requirements

-   A modern web browser with JavaScript enabled.
